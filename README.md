# Classical-Cipher-DAD

Classical-Cipher-DAD (Detector and Decoder) is a small project I am working on currently. It can detect and decode a limited amount of classical cipher such as the Cesar, Playfair, Vignere, Affine, Monoalphabetic, and Transposition cipher.

# Project Layout
Currently the project uses [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/)as its packet manager, because I am used to it and I like it. The project is currently on the planning phase as I work on creating the dataset to complete this transformer neural network.
